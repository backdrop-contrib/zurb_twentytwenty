Need to highlight the differences between two images? TwentyTwenty, a 
visual diff tool, makes it easy to spot them!

This module provides a field formatter for Image fields to display them for 
TwentyTwenty comparison. The Image field must have two images to work 
properly, as it is showing a comparison of two images. Setting the number 
of values to two is required before the field will render properly.
